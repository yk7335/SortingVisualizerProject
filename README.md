# SortingVisualizerProject

This python program currently contains 4 files. 3 Sorting algorithms (merge, bubble, and quick sort) and one main file which uses these sorting algorithms and Tkinter to create a visualization of how each sorting algorithm behaves when solving random arrays. 

Download instructions:
  If you just want to run the program you can download .exe file and start the file, (the program does take 5-8 seconds to run). I have also attached my source code if anyone is     interested.
  
Credits:
I did find this project as a tutorial and used it to get familiar with Tkinter and more comfortable with sorting mechanism. The tutorial only convered 3 sorting algorithms I plan to add more update the files in a new branch.
